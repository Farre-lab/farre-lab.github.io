Our lab aims to study  genome evolution and the genetic changes associated with individual and species differences, applying the newest comparative and functional genomic techniques and the great wealth of genomic data available. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of chromosomal evolution in mammals. Although genome and chromosome evolution have been long studied  we still know very little about the functional consequences of these changes and the role they might have played during evolution. To address these questions, we use ruminants and rodents as models and take a multidisciplinary approach that combines experimental (WGS, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq) and bioinformatic analysis, generating results of interest to diverse fields.
