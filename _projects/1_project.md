We study how genomes differ across species and lineages, with a focus on chromosomal evolution, structural variation, and genome architecture. By comparing genomes across mammals and other vertebrates, we aim to understand the evolutionary forces shaping genome structure â€” and how these changes may contribute to adaptation, speciation, and diversity in genome function.
