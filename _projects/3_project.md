We use genomic tools to address urgent questions in biodiversity conservation. Our work often focuses on non-model and endangered species, for which we generate new genomic resources and study patterns of genetic diversity, gene flow, and demographic history. We are especially interested in how structural variants, such as chromosomal rearrangements, may act as hidden barriers to gene flow within or between populations.

A unique aspect of our work is the use of historical DNA from museum collections, allowing us to investigate temporal shifts in genetic diversity and reconstruct the evolutionary past of species over centuries. This approach has provided valuable insights into long-term population dynamics and informed conservation strategies.
