PhD student.

I previously studied a BSc in Biology and MSc by Research in Genetics at the University of Kent. It was here that I became interested in applied genetics and genomics for environmental and conservation research. I then went on to work as a Research Assistant at the University of Aberdeen in bioinformatics and metagenomics of microorganisms in soil ecosystems.
My PhD project in the Farr√© lab aims to address the loss of biodiversity in Gabon by using genetic and genomic techniques to inform the management of a declining ruminant species, the waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), through working with the Aspinall Foundation and researchers in Gabon. This project is funded by the Global Challenges Doctoral Centre.
